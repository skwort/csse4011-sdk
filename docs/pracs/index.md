# Pracs Overview

This section contains **companion notes** for each CSSE4011 practical.

Each prac writeup here is **not** a step-by-step guide â€” the official prac
specification is in your course materials. Instead, these pages:

- Clarify **how the SDK and Zephyr are used** in each prac.
- Provide **extra code examples** relevant to the prac.
- Highlight **common pitfalls** and debugging tips.
