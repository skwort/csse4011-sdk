## Practical Zephyr (Memfault)

The *Practical Zephyr* series from Memfault is easily one of the better deep
dives into how Zephyr works. It’s written by people who know what they’re
doing, and it doesn’t waste your time.

1. [Zephyr Basics (Part 1) – 10 Jan 2024](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/practical_zephyr_basics)
2. [Kconfig (Part 2) – 24 Jan 2024](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/practical_zephyr_kconfig)
3. [Devicetree Basics (Part 3) – 01 Feb 2024](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/practical_zephyr_dt)
4. [Devicetree Semantics (Part 4) – 15 Feb 2024](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/practical_zephyr_dt_semantics)
5. [Devicetree Practice (Part 5) – 17 Apr 2024](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/practical_zephyr_05_dt_practice)
6. [West Workspaces (Part 6) – 16 May 2024](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/practical_zephyr_west)

If you only read two articles, make them **Kconfig** and **Devicetree Basics**.

## Nordic Developer Academy

Nordic’s nRF Connect SDK runs on top of Zephyr. Their training material is
aimed at their hardware, but the Zephyr concepts apply directly to our work.

- [nRF Connect SDK Intermediate](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-intermediate/)
- [Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/bluetooth-low-energy-fundamentals/)

## Zephyr Video Tutorials (Digi-Key)

If you prefer to watch rather than read, Digi-Key has a YouTube playlist that
walks through Zephyr setup and basic development.

- [Introduction to Zephyr – Part 1: Getting Started & Blink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTJ_vKlMS_4&list=PLEBQazB0HUyTmK2zdwhaf8bLwuEaDH-52)

## Golioth Blog

The Golioth blog offers a diverse range of Zephyr-focused articles. While many
are insightful, it's best to be selective based on your current needs.

### Recommended Reads

- [How to Write a Zephyr Device Driver with a Custom API](https://blog.golioth.io/how-to-write-a-zephyr-device-driver-with-a-custom-api/)
- [Zephyr’s Native Simulator with Offloaded Sockets](https://blog.golioth.io/zephyrs-native-simulator-with-offloaded-sockets/)
- [Automated Hardware Testing using Pytest](https://blog.golioth.io/automated-hardware-testing-using-pytest/)

These articles are particularly beneficial for students aiming to deepen their
understanding of Zephyr's inner workings and enhance their development
workflows. They aren't exactly relevant to the course material and should be
viewed as extension topics.

## CSSE4011 Tutorial Docs

A series of tutorials on Zephyr developed by former CSSE4011 students. These
are a little bit old now, but the content is still quite correct and relevant.
